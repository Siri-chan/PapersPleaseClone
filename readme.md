# Papers Please Clone
Welcome to my Papers Please Clone! This is a slightly weird fork of a local repository;  
If you want to see history from before this, copy /prehistory/git/* to an empty directory.  
I am also timing the whole process of creating this project (apart from fucking with version control and etc.); therefore each commit will begin with a timestamp (xxhryyminzzsec;;)  
You can contribute names, and other metadata to this project [here](https://forms.gle/GpkncAgXvYA69fQt6).  
## Why?
I wanted to learn the new input system, as well as how to use 2D Unity. I've done at least one of those.  
This is not officially related to the talented work of Lucas Pope, and I hope to distance the project from it when it is a bit more complete.
## How do I... ?
- Left to Deny  
- Right to Confirm
This works for the Arrow Keys, Mouse Buttons, A and D and even the Left Stick of your Controller!
